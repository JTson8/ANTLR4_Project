-------------ANTLR4 PROJECT REPOSITORY README--------------

This repository contains an ANTL4 project. Where I took a
DOT.g4 file and used ANTLR to generate a parser and lexer
for the DOT language.

I then edited the base listener to help the walker pretty
print and correctly format any given inputted DOT code.

The main can be found in the PLSCourseProject.java file

More info on the DOT language can be found here:
